# Writing a Project Proposal

The goal of the final project is to bring the conceptual dimension of the class together with the visualization techniques we’ve learned. You will develop and implement a final project following a complete, iterative design process. The first step in this is the creation of a set of proposals.

####Process
You should aim to generate about **10 ideas** during the next week that are intellectually distinct, address a diverse range of points of view, and explore different subject domains and levels of complexity. Work rapidly and don't get hung up on polishing anything digitally — limit yourself to handwritten notes and sketches during this phase while you are doing research (recommended: 10 ideas in a 1 hour session).

During the research and sketching process, address the following questions:

  - What are some observations you find noteworthy?
  - What insights could this offer?
  - How is it related to visualization, what can visualization reveal here?
  - What new ideas came out of the process of sketching and research?
  - What are the next steps?

Refine your list daily and let your initial set of ideas sit for at least a day before you take things a step further. Talk about your ideas with a peer outside of class (their level of expertise does not matter here).

####Ideas & Sources (due 8 Nov)

List your **ten** ideas in the `process/ideas.txt` file in your student directory. Each idea can be described in 2 or 3 sentences, but make sure you outline the subject matter being considered, the question being asked, and the format (digital vs print, static vs interactive, diagram vs text vs map, etc.) you intend to use.

For **five** of these, find at least one datasource and record the details in your `process/datasources.txt` file. There is a placeholder entry in the file describing the USGS feeds. Delete that entry, but use it as a model for the five new entries you'll be adding.

####Proposals (due 15 Nov)

Select **3 ideas** to develop further and create a one-page proposal for *each* of them addressing the questions above.

- Make sure your ideas remain diverse, but be sure to pose specific questions (too much breadth will eventually become paralyzing)
- Identify the data sources (plural!) that contribute evidence to your subject (look in particular for CSV, TSV, JSON, XML, or SQL sources)
- Collect public URLs for those sources and list them in your `datasources.txt` file so we can share them as a class
- Summarize each of the 3 final project ideas as a 1-page project proposal. Including a rough visual sketch (photo of a pencil sketch, diagram, index, or score) is recommended but optional.
    - If you don’t include a sketch, then describe your visualization approach thoroughly.
- Create one PDF called `proposals.pdf` that combines each of the three 1-page proposals into one document.
- Put the combined PDF in your `process` folder and push to the github repo
